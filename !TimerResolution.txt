it is from 2004 to 25H2 it is fixed at 1k MHz
Well, the system itself sets a timer for all applications
Even if you put 0.5 MHz
There will still be 1k MHz in games
And even on old ones it is recommended to set it to 1 MHz because the game timer will be set to 1k MHz
Well, 0.5 MHz more system timer interrupts
Only for Windows 11 you can make a timer
But I don't see the point in it
If games and programs automatically set the timer to 1k MHz
But in 1909 everything is different
Because the timer is not fixed

if you set the timer to Windows, then your processor threads and integration will work poorly if it is below this value 1K MHz

How do we know that people from Win11 know that they have a kernel from W25 Server which means itâ€™s not a bad core. but the timer cannot be set, take into account what CIS people wrote above

!!! WORK ONLY 1909, W22 server !!!
